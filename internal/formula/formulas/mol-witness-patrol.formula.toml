A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-<rig>-<name> 2>/dev/null && echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/<name>\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke <name>\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: <polecat> has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: <name>\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: <uncommitted-files>\nUnpushed commits: <count>\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/<name> 2>/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:<name> --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke <name>  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge <rig>/polecats/<name> \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: <polecat> stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat <name> reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state."
