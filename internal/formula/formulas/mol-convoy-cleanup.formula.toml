Archive completed convoys and notify overseer.

Dogs work through molecules (poured from this formula) when convoys complete. The Deacon detects completed
convoys (all tracked issues closed) and slings this work to a dog for:
- Generating convoy summary
- Archiving convoy state
- Notifying the overseer (Mayor)
- Updating activity feed

## Dog Contract

This is infrastructure work. You:
1. Receive convoy ID via hook_bead
2. Generate summary of completed work
3. Archive to appropriate location
4. Notify stakeholders
5. Return to kennel

## Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| convoy | hook_bead | The convoy ID to archive |

## Failure Modes

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Convoy not found | Exit with error, notify Deacon |
| Archive location full | Create space, retry, or escalate |
| Mail send fails | Retry once, then proceed anyway |"""

**2. Verify convoy is complete:**
- Status should be 'closed' or all tracked issues closed
- If convoy is still open, exit - Deacon dispatched too early

```bash

Run the lora-forge training data pipeline against this convoy's sessions.

cd ~/gt/lora_forge/mayor/rig
python3 -m scripts.harvest_convoy {{convoy}} -v

**2. Check output:**
The script will print JSON stats showing:
- Number of session files found
- Samples generated per role
- Secrets scrubbed
- Duplicates removed

**3. If harvest fails or finds no sessions:**
This is non-blocking — log the issue but proceed to return-to-kennel.
